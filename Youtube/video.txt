hi welcome back in this video I will discuss the introduction part of artificial neural network in the coming videos I will discuss the different concepts of artificial neural network in detail artificial neural network is an information processing model similar to the human brain that is the way the human race brain processes the information similarly the artificial neural network processes the information but the artificial neural network cannot do the functionalities all the functionalities of brain because brain is a very complex nervous system it does a lot of computation and those computations cannot be replicated in an artificial neural network but still we can do most of the functions what brain does in artificial neural network an artificial neural network is composed of a large number of Highly interconnected processing units those processing units are called as neurons those neurons are connected so that we can solve a particular problem like a human being for example the human being learn a particular concept or anything by experience for example initially with some examples he may learn or he may get some knowledge but as and when he has been shown with more number of examples the human being will learn or get more knowledge similar to that one as and when you go on giving more and more number of example to artificial neural network it will go on getting more and more knowledge in this case or it will learn more and more an artificial neural network is configured for a specific application or to solve a particular problem that is to solve a Spam classification phase recognition pattern recognition or similar to such kind of any application that is you cannot solve all the problems using one artificial neural network a particular artificial neural network can solve one problem at a time that is the one more very important part we need to remember but brain is brain works in such a way that it will try to solve or it will solve every problem over here each neuron is connected with other neuron with a connection Link in artificial neural network as I said earlier each computation unit is called as a neuron and the network contain multiple number of neurons they are connected with one another that connection is done with a link and each and every link is associated with a particular weight whenever we given a signal to that particular Neuron a neuron that input signal and the weight will be transferred to the next neuron with the help of this particular Link in this case uh this information that is the weight whatever we have assigned to that particular link or what is whatever it is learned by that particular artificial neural network is used to solve a particular problem in this case the artificial neural network is characterized uh by their ability to learn recall and generalize the training patterns or the data similar to the human brain the way human brain works with the same note the artificial neural network work like they will learn and then they recall and generalize the training pattern over here uh they have the capability to model the networks of original neurons as found in the brain that's the reason these artificial neural networks uh are called as the processing units of artificial neural networks are called as the neurons that are also called as the artificial neurons in this case each neuron has a internal state of its own as I said earlier there will be multiple number of neurons in a n each of them have their own internal state that internal state is called as the activation level that activation level is transmitted to other neurons with the help of other Link in this case ah we will take a very simple example to understand the simple artificial neural network in this artificial neural network we have two layers uh the first one is called as the input layer and there is another layer called as output layer these are the minimum two layers every artificial neural network has in the input layer we have two neurons that is denoted by X1 and X2 and Y is the output neuron in this case that is the output layer has one neuron and input layer has two neurons the totally we have three neurons in this particular Network this X1 and X2 are the inputs to this particular neuron and Y is the output of this particular output neuron as I said earlier each of these neurons are connected with a link in this case X1 and Y is connected with this link X2 and Y is connected with this link and each and every link is associated with some weight initially we have assigned some random weight to each and every link and we perform some computation here and finally we will get this particular output once you get this particular output or once the termination condition is satisfied whatever the weight we have assigned to these two w one and W2 that is the final one otherwise if if this termination condition is not satisfied we have to go back and modify this particular weights in this case so to modify these particular weights we have some different algorithms like gradient descent back propagation and so on so we have to apply and update this particular weights in this case now what kind of computation takes place in each and every neuron is for example at this particular neuron why the two kind of things takes place or every neuron does these two things that is uh it performs something called as a summation and then it performs something called as it will apply something called as activation function over here on the top of that particular summation that is summation is nothing but the sum of product of input and weight here that is nothing but you can say that Y in is equivalent to X1 to W1 plus x 2 W 2 in this case that is X1 is input W1 is the weight X2 is the input W 2 is the weight in this case now this is the first thing performed at this particular output layer and then once you get this particular Y in we need to perform something called as or we need to apply something called as activation function so once you apply this particle activation function on the top of Y we will get the output here as I said earlier if you reach this particular termination condition these are the final weights otherwise we have to go back and modify this particular way it's unless and until we reach the termination condition here and one more very important thing is this activation function is uh uh not fixed one based on our requirement we can apply some different uh activation functions like uh step function sine function sigmoid relio and so on there were a lot of activation functions are there based on our requirement we need to apply this particular Sigma this activation function on the top of this particular summation term so that we can get the output here one once you get the output uh you you can use this particular thing for making the decision like whether we have to terminate this particular thing or we need to go and update this particular weights here so in this video I have explained the what is artificial neural network what are the components of artificial neural network and how a simple artificial neural network works over here I hope the concept is clear if you like the video do like and share with your friends press the Subscribe button for more videos press the
